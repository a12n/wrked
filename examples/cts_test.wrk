{ The CTS Field Test can be completed on an indoor trainer, or you can
  find a relatively flat course or a course that is a consistent climb
  of about a 6 percent grade. (A course with steep climbs or descents
  will dictate your effort more than you will.) Above all, find a
  course thatâ€™s safe, without stop signs or traffic lights. For the
  sake of being able to compare one test to another, complete the test
  in weather conditions that are reasonably common for your area. }
